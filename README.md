This work is an extension of [AM_traj](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/am_traj) from Fei Gao el. Due to the large number of constant matrices in the calculation of Alternating Minimization optimization, it is difficult to complete an efficient and general algorithm. So this package just realize the 5-th order and 7-th order optimization algorithm.
